# AtomPhysics

This is not only a buggy physics engine -- it's also a buggy game!

There are "Atoms", which can bump into and bond with each other.  
The goal is to build a bridge to get the red ball to the other side.

This project features two ArrayLists -- bondList and atomList -- that have to work in unison.
There are also quadtrees, but they don't really help.
